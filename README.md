# Submission For Bertram Capital: Who Buys Coffee

## How To Run Code
There are 2 data structures and 1 global variable that can be updated and tested. Those are the drinkPrices dictionary, the pairs dictionary, and the totalSum variable. You can update the prices of the drinks, the amount a person has previously paid, what drink they buy, how many people, etc.. You can also update how much has already been spent. Then just run the code in the terminal. You can use a for loop to see how the person who is paying changes as the total sum/the amount they have paid has changed

## Pre-entered Data
I have pre-entered data to demonstrate the layout of my data structures and to make it easier to run the code. Please feel free to follow that format for either dictionary
